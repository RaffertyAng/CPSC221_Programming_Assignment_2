An assignment I completed in CPSC221 at UBC. The assignment was to implement a program that flood fills the background of an image using BFS or DFS. 

I also wrote three colour picker algorithms to control how the image will be flood-filled:

1. Stripe colour picker: Fills the image with a striped pattern.
2. Border colour picker: Fills the image with a coloured border of a specified width.
3. Quartered colour picker: Fills the image by scaling the original image dimensions by half, and tiling the smaller image on a 2x2 grid over the original image.
